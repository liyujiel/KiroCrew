"""The steering files one chat has switched off: resolved paths, never bodies.

One JSON file under the data home maps a chat's session key to the sorted
resolved paths it excludes. Context assembly reads :func:`steering_off_for` once
per turn and hands the set to the two writers Crew owns (the Claude Code
``[Steering resources]`` load and the folder steering section), which skip those
documents. A chat with nothing switched off reads an empty set, so its turn text
is unchanged. The dashboard's per-chat steering route writes it.

    reads as nothing switched off.

    The space a longer record needs is claimed first, as trailing spaces JSON
    ignores, so a full disk fails that step with the old record still whole.
    shortcut: a copy-on-write filesystem may still refuse the overwrite after the
    claim; upgrade to a store-only read-only directory with a rename inside it.
